            While reusable water bottles are a step in the right direction, they come with their own challenges:
            *   **Bacterial Growth:** Many reusable water bottles harbor high levels of bacteria, often far exceeding safe limits,
                leading to potential health risks and unpleasant odors.
            *   **Cleaning Difficulties:** Narrow-mouth designs and intricate crevices make thorough cleaning with manual brushes
                or hand washing nearly impossible, leaving behind residues and biofilms where microbes thrive.
            *   **Lack of Public Facilities:** The absence of specialized bottle cleaning equipment in public spaces like schools,
                offices, and gyms often leads users to skip or rush cleaning, accelerating bacterial growth.
            *   **User Habits:** A significant portion of users do not rinse their bottles daily, contributing to the hygiene problem.
